// Package ctlproto is the local control-API wire protocol for driving a running
// cats server from a CLI or automation client. It is the second front-end onto
// cats' protocol-neutral §7 command table — the browser (WS9) is the first. A
// client sends a newline-framed JSON Request naming a §7 command; the server
// dispatches it through its dispatcher and replies with a single JSON Response.
//
// The command names and their params/result shapes are cats' `wire` package,
// which this repo imports directly (github.com/rohanthewiz/cats/wire). Only the
// envelope below is a copy: it is the server's own internal/ctlproto file, kept
// here because that package is under internal/ and cannot be imported. Re-sync
// it by copying cats' internal/ctlproto/{proto,client}.go and re-applying the
// `wire` retargeting in the comments — the code itself is meant to be identical.
//
// Not copied: server.go (it imports cats' internal/app) and stream.go, whose
// server half needs that Server type. A client here that wanted events.subscribe
// would have to port stream.go's Subscribe alone.
//
// The default transport is a per-request round trip over a local (unix) socket:
// one Request in, one Response out, then the connection closes. Two methods layer
// onto that base without disturbing it:
//
//   - pane.wait_for_output is still one Request → one Response, only the response
//     is delayed until the pane's output matches (or the wait times out). It rides
//     the unchanged envelope; the server just grants it a longer backstop.
//   - events.subscribe (MethodEventsSubscribe) is the one streaming method: the
//     server writes an ack Response, then zero or more Event frames on the same
//     newline-framed connection until the client disconnects (see stream.go).

// MethodClipboardRead returns the host system clipboard's text; its
// Response.Data is a ClipboardData. Like MethodPair it is deliberately NOT a §7
// command, and for the same structural reason: the §7 table is shared with the
// browser front end, so anything on it is reachable from a network-facing client
// holding a session cookie. The clipboard is the user's, not the session's — it
// holds whatever they last copied anywhere on the machine, in any application —
// and a remote client that could ask for it would be reading over their shoulder.
// Keeping the method off that table is what confines it to the owner-only control
// socket; the server answers it before its dispatcher ever sees the name.
//
// There is no config flag gating it beyond that. A caller already holding this
// socket can run `pane.send_input` to type `pbpaste` into any shell pane and read
// the answer back with `capture`, so a switch here would gate nothing it does not
// already have — it would only make the honest path look more privileged than the
// dishonest one. The socket's 0600 owner-only mode is the boundary.
